# Markdown Docs
This repository contains the definition of a Docker image that can be used both as a **[builder](#as-docker-builder)** stage and as an **[action](#as-github-action)**.

Markdown docs is implemented as a jam of shell scripts, python scripts and python utilities like [Python Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown), with some additional plugins like [Table of Contents](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/toc/), [Tables](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/tables/) and, on top of all, [PlantUML Markdown](https://github.com/mikitex70/plantuml-markdown). This extension enables the inclusion of PlantUML diagrams (UML, JSON...) rendered _inline_ inside your website. It also supports the `!include` directive for PlantUML reuse of code.
